# Simple-mpc

**Simple-mpc** is a C++ implementation of multiple predictive control schemes for locomotion based on the Aligator optimization solver.

It can be used with quadrupeds and bipeds to generate whole-body walking motions based on a pre-defined contact plan.

## Features

The **Simple-mpc** library provides:

* an interface to generate different locomotion gaits in a MPC-like fashion
* Python bindings to enable fast prototyping
* three different kinds of locomotion dynamics (centroidal, kinodynamics and full dynamics)

## Installation

### Build from source (devel)

1. Clone repo.
```bash
mkdir -p simple-mpc_ws/src
cd simple-mpc_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:edantec/simple-mpc.git --recursive
```

2. Create conda environment.
(It is recommended to use `mamba` instead of `conda` for faster/better dependencies solving)
```bash
mamba env create -f simple-mpc/environment-devel.yaml
mamba activate simple-mpc-devel
```

3. Clone some dependencies
(Some dependencies are not available on conda, or not with adequate versions)
(vcs allow for cloning and managing multiple repo at once)
```bash
vcs import --recursive < simple-mpc/devel-git-deps.yaml
```

4. Build all packages
```bash
export MAKEFLAGS="-j4" # It is recommended to reduce the number of jobs as you ram might get full easily with the default number.
cd ..
colcon build --event-handlers console_direct+ --cmake-args \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release             \
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX      \
-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python)    \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER='ccache' \
-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF                    \
-DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF              \
-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF                   \
-DBUILD_BENCHMARK=OFF                  \
-DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF                 \
-DBUILD_WITH_COLLISION_SUPPORT=ON      \
-DGENERATE_PYTHON_STUBS=OFF
```

5. Source the environment
(This step need to be repeated every time a new shell is opened. It can be put in your ~/.bashrc)
```bash
mamba activate simple-mpc-devel # If not already done
source install/setup.bash
```
